# Interaction with 360ยบ Hotspot dynamically created in Virtual Reality

This exercise is an improvement of the exercise [[Interaction with 360ยบ Hotspot elements in Virtual Reality](https://github.com/andresilmor/Interaction-with-360-Hotspot-elements-in-Virtual-Reality)] where an 360ยบ image is mapped with "static" points of interest in which we can click and display more information about, NOW, instead of the mapping being maded in the Unity Editor and being "Static" the mapping is created on base of the information inserted on a JSON file, in which we can put the information to be displayed (text/image/video) and the location of the point of interest, with that said there's still a need to do a setup of the mapping on the Editor to get the position of the points of the interest, but after that information being writted down in JSON, the mapping can easelly be shared without the need of copying the project.
